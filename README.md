Future developement:
- add buttons to switch between notation and numbers
- add 1-9 buttons to click on and highlight all numbers that matches
- ability to input your own given numbers (ex: if you have a paper puzzle that you want to use a computer instead)
- ability to reset board back to given numbers only
- add undo buttons
- add save function to finish the puzzle later
- ability to change background colors of tiles individually
- maybe more in the future
